%\section{Phase I}
%We want to define the scope of the current project such that it is something we feel we can accomplish, and be relatively complete in our data collection.
%


\section{Procedure}
%Three primary tasks 
%\begin{itemize}
%\item \textbf{Data Research} The person assigned to data research will search the literature to find out \underline{what data has been taken for a given nova.} 
%\item \textbf{Data Acquisition} The person assigned to retrieving the data: this can mean either downloading the data or contacting the author of the original paper.
%\item \textbf{Data Importation} The person assigned to incorporating the data into the ONC software.
%\end{itemize}
Three step procedure:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Data Research} Data research involves searching the literature to find out what data has been taken for a given nova.
\item \textbf{Data Acquisition} Retrieving the data. This can mean either downloading the data or contacting the author of the original paper.
\item \textbf{Data Importation} Incorporating the data into the ONC software.
\end{itemize}



We will use the ticket system: each new piece of data will be assigned a ticket. This serves a two-fold purpose: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item  It ensures that we are, at the very least, aware of all of the data that has been used in published articles for a given nova.
\item It ensures that, from the start, we maintain an accurate provenance for each piece of data, as well as complete meta-data.
\end{enumerate}

Tickets will be initially created in the data research step, and fields will be filled in during both the data research and data acquisition steps. A complete ticket means that the data is ready to be incorporated into the ONC.

%\section*{Guiding Principles}
%These are taken from James' paper. Since we are already using James' format, some of the principles are (essentially) built in for us, so I've reordered them based on what I think will be most important for us to keep in mind as we move along.
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item \textbf{Accuracy and Accountability}: We need to make sure that we include \emph{all} relevant information for any given dataset
%\item \textbf{Completeness and Persistence}: We need to hunt down all possible data sources with a fervent determination. Our goal should always be to have \emph{everything that is publicly available}. There is no such thing as a dataset too small.
%\item \textbf{Community Driven}: The more we can get people involved and invested, the easier our job will be.
%\item \textbf{Accessibility}
%\item \textbf{Integration}
%
%\end{itemize}

%\section*{Tasks}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item \textbf{Data Collection}: This will be an ongoing process, and falls under the purview of the data acquisition leader. Here is a list of tasks that we can do to get started.
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Contact Fred Walter and Ulisse Munari, who already have extensive datasets for southern and northern novae, respectively.  
%\item Pull from AAVSO. I believe we can do this in an automated way.
%\item Get radio data, both from e-NOVA and from literature.
%\end{enumerate}
%\item \textbf{Data Formatting}: This falls under the purview of the software leader
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Determine what format James' software is going to be expecting 
%\item Write software that will reformat the data so that it is compatible with James' software. 
%\end{enumerate}
%\item \textbf{Quality Control}: This falls under the purview of the quality control leader
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Make sure that all data can be traced back to its origin
%\item Make sure that all measured values have associated uncertainties. I'm not sure what we should do with data that doesn't have uncertainties...
%\end{enumerate}
